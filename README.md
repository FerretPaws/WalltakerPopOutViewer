# WalltakerPopOutViewer
A Python-based WallTaker client with support for pop-out viewing and new image notifications!

# Key Features
- User Interface and Theme: Dark mode UI with customizable polling and pop-out window sizes, notification volume, and toast messages to provide quick feedback to the user.
- Pop-Out Mode: Offers a toggleable pop-out window to display images separately, with adjustable size. The pop-out is resizable and movable for convenience.
- User Information Display: Retrieves and shows details about the user who set the image, including username, friend status, online status, and number of links set, with a clickable link to the user's account, and a clickable link to the e621 image.
- Responses and Custom Replies: Includes emoji-based quick responses and a text field for custom responses, which can be sent back to Walltakerâ€™s API for interactive engagement.
- System Tray Integration: Minimizes to the system tray with the option to close, run in the background, or fully exit from the tray menu.
- Adjustable Polling and Notification Settings: Sliders for setting polling delay, pop-out size, and notification volume allow easy customization and control.

# Known Issues
- You must close the app twice through the system tray for it to fully close
- The app does not support videos or gifs (Sorry! This is just a limitation of my knowledge of Python!)
- Large images will clip inside the main GUI mindow but will show fine in pop-out mode. This is intentional.

# How to install/use
1. Download the .exe from the [Releases](https://github.com/FerretPaws/WalltakerPopOutViewer/releases) tab. (KEEP THE EXE INSIDE A FOLDER!!)
2. Run the .exe, it will create 3 more files that will store your Link ID and API Key, your data is never stored anywhere but those files on your PC, don't share them.
3. The program will run, input your Link ID and API Key and it will give you a sound to confirm it connected and then automatic polling will start.
4. Enjoy! Feel free to change settings as you see fit!
